Strings are sequences of characters.Each character is 
a Unicode symbol. Represented by the string data type 
in C# (System.String).String objects contain 
an immutable (read-only) sequence of characters. 
Strings use Unicode to support multiple languages 
and alphabets. Strings are stored in the dynamic 
memory (managed heap) . System.String is reference type.
